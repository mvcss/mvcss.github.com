## Helpers

Helpers are the extendable classes, functions, mixins, and animations used throughout an MVCSS application.

### Common Use Cases

*   Clearfixes
*   Unit conversions
*   Vendor prefix mixins with included fallbacks
*   Shorthands for verbose syntaxes (e.g., media queries)
*   Reusable keyframe animations

***Note:*** Animations unique to specific structures are defined at the bottom of their respective style sheets.
