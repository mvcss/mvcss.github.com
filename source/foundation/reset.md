Foundation - Reset
==================

As long as the project size warrants it, we always get things started with a style reset. [Normalize.css][normalize] is what we use (and it is what's included by default), but alternatives like the [Eric Meyer Reset CSS][meyer-reset] are easily interchangeable.
