## Reset

As long as the project size warrants it, we always get things started with a style reset. [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is what we use (and it is what's included by default), but alternatives like the [Eric Meyer Reset CSS](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css) are easily interchangeable.
