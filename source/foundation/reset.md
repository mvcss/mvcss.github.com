Foundation - Reset
==================

As long as the project size warrants it, we always get things started with a reset style sheet. We use [Normalize.css][normalize] (and include it with MVCSS by default), but alternatives like Eric Meyer's [Reset CSS][meyer-reset] are easily interchangeable.

[meyer-reset]: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css
