Styleguide
==========

Before diving in, we’ll start with a bit of housekeeping. This section outlines our internal standards for writing CSS (and more specifically, Sass). While you’re certainly welcome to switch it up, these guidelines will help in moving through our examples and base files.

We’re big proponents of the Sass indented syntax (`.sass`), so things may look slightly different if you’re a Sassy CSS (`.scss`) fan.

**Word of warning:** some of the sections herein will be a bit confusing, like Naming Conventions, until seen in context later—an unfortunate chicken/egg situation.
