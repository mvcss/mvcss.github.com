# Library

The [library](http://github.com/mvcss/library/) is a collection of Sass modules and JavaScript (CoffeeScript) components we commonly use. If you're seeking a framework moreso than a methodology, this is your jumping off point for items like grids, tabs, buttons, and forms. You can just plug the modules/components into your base MVCSS project.
